1. Common Function Types:
  a - public: Anyone can call this Function
  b - private: Only this contract can call this Function
  c - view: This function returns data and does not modify the contract's data
  d - constant:   'same as above' "deprecated"
  e - pure: function will not modify or even read the contract's data
  f - payable: When someone call this function they might send ether along

2. We CANNOT return data from a function that modifies our contract.

!IMPORTANT
3. When we define a storage variable,
 and mark that variable with a 'public' keyword, then:
 the contract will automatically create a new function with the exact same name as the variable.
 When the function is called, it returns the variable itself.

4. Difference between a money sending transaction and a contract creation transaction:
 the 'to' field is EMPTY in a contract creation transaction

5. 2 ways to run Contract Functions:
  a - CALLING a function
     - CANNOT MODIFY the contracts data
     - Can return data
     - Runs instantly
     - Free to execute
  b - Sending a Transaction to a function
     - Can MODIFY a contract's data
     - Takes time to execute
     - Returns the transaction hash
     - Costs money to execute
