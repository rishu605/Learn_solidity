1. Ethereum networks can transfer money AS WELL AS store data.

2. Ethereum network consists of multiple nodes.

3. Node - A machine running an Ethereum client

4. Each Node has a full copy of the Blockchain

5. Blockchain - A database that stores a record of every transaction that has ever taken place

6. Technology for Devs to create applications - Web3.js

7. Technology for consumers using the Ethereum Network - Metamask

8. When an account is created on Metamask, it has following three important things:
 a - Account Address
 b - Public Key
 c - Private Key

 All these are stored as hexadecimal

9. Time taken to hash everything from zero to  a target nonce value - BLOCK TIME

10. In effect, nonce is calculated under the candition that the resulting hash is less than a particular decimal number

11. ETHEREUM has a Target Block time of 15 seconds

12. Smart Contract - An account controlled by code.

13. Smart Contract account has following info:
  a - balance: Amount of ether this account owns
  b - storage: Data storage for this Contract
  c - Raw machine code for this contract

14. Difference between a Smart Contract Account and an account created using client like Metamask:
 a - A metamask account is the same for each network 
     BUT 
     A Smart Contract Account stays only in the network in which it was created
 
15. Solidity Compiler creates 2 separate files:
  a - Byte Code for deployment to the Ethereum Network
  b - Application Binary Interface(ABI)

16. 1 Ether = 10^18 Wei
    1 Ether = 10^9 Gwei/Shannon/Nanoether/Nano
    1 Ether = 10^3 Finney/Milliether/Milli

17. Gas - Used to measure how much work we are executing with our code.

18. gasPrice: Amount of Wei the sender is willing to pay per unit gas to get this transaction processed

19. startGas/gasLimit: Maximum Unit of gas that this transaction can consume.
